# Gather Town Game Page
this is for gather.town app so my friends and I have a easier life when we wanna play board game in my space.

### Goals:
- [x] create a intermedia page so we can add private room string to the url and join a private room directly.
- [x] each entrance could have a default game link
- [ ] create a json file for list of games so we can use one entrance in a space and play many games
- [ ] add intro for each game
- [ ] add a better UI for the page
